Zero latency.

This is a term that I came up with to describe the ability to take an idea to execution, with little foot-dragging.

I'd say it's a superset of preventing procrastination; not only do you get your day-to-day tasks done, but any creative inspiration you have, you take on.

This is something that I admire in many people I see online, usually with web dev projects.

If I'm considering flossing\* tonight, me going to floss right now is zero latency. If I'm thinking, "Wouldn't it be cool to make this project?", then I should go and make that project.

This year I want to reduce my ping, and approach zero latency. To be reasonable, I will track this as, I'm successful if every **other** decision I make is with zero latency.

This will be recorded in my wins tracker.

To end off this first blog post, I'm going to leave this quote here.

> Imagine you’re on your deathbed—and standing around your bed are the ghosts representing your unfilled potential. The ghosts of the ideas you never acted on. The ghosts of the talents you didn’t use. And they’re standing around your bed. Angry. Disappointed. Upset. ‘We came to you because you could have brought us to life,’they say. ‘And now we go to the grave together.’ So I ask you today: How many ghosts are going to be around your bed when your time comes?

    *Ever think about how flossing is the ultimate litmus test if you’re a
    disciplined person? I guarantee you that every disciplined person flosses
    every night. Without fail. And there are no consequences to not flossing
    once in a while, but there is certainly a difference between someone who
    flosses every so often and someone who flosses every day. It’s in the
    mindset. If you’re able to come back home after a very long day and get into
    your night routine, you’re disciplined.
