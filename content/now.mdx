# Now

last updated 2025-03-16

currently:

-   practicing cold email pitching
-   volunteering for the [socratica symposium](https://socratica.info) and meeting all of the cool people who are organizing it
-   using Twitter without getting addicted to the feed... I haven't been posting as much as I'd like to

self improvement:

-   attempting to eat breakfast more often
-   still chasing the holy grail of flow state
-   working on a cool project with friends who move really fast - must ship faster!!

misc.

-   trying out a curling iron as an alternative to perms
-   recently realized I want to write essays again, but this time about things I feel strongly about
