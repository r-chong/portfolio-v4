currently:

-   practicing cold email pitching
-   gave out shawarma at the [socratica symposium](https://socratica.info) and met all of the cool people who are organizing it
-   posting on Twitter more often now

self improvement:

-   still chasing the holy grail of flow state
-   working on a cool project with friends who move really fast - must ship faster!

misc.

-   trying out a curling iron as an alternative to perms
-   finals season is coming and it's going to be rough
