# Now

last updated 2025-07-02

-   Work is going well but I'm deeply unsatisfied with what I've been able to do after work. This second half of the summer I need to lock in
-   Gonna be working on embedded systems soon @ elastic which is going to be interesting!
-   Torial is going somewhere it seems
-   kinda stopped using Twitter. I'm really evaluating what I'm trying to get out of it. Once I finish my next project I will post though

misc.

-   maybe visiting SF in july
-   spending a lot of weekends away from home
-   got put onto latin music
