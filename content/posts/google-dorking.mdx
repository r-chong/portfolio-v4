How do you find really obscure pieces of information on the internet? The internet is so huge that it's guaranteed that the obscure thing you're looking for exists.
Things are usually buried under mounds of sponsored results, SEO-optimized pages filled with zero substance, and everything you don't want to find.

Most people don't know that you can use powerful parameters on your Google searches. If you want to find only Reddit results, you can write `site:reddit.com` in your search and it will filter out all non-Reddit links. If you want to see information from before the pandemic, you can write `before:2020-01-01`. Put words or sentences in quotations if you want an exact match. Each of those can be negated by writing a `-` in front. Did I mention this all works with logical operators like OR and AND?
The list goes on. I've forked a handy guide at this [github gist](https://gist.github.com/r-chong/93b4a0e16230df1112c88e6ef76eaed8)

Now that's definitely a lot of things to remember. So you can just ChatGPT to create a Google dorking query for you! It can go overboard in its filtering so you may need to make some tweaks. I usually find erasing the parameters is easier than thinking of them to write.
While you're doing this you can also start a ChatGPT Deep Research session to run in the background. There are many ways to get the information you want.

Here's an example query I used this year for job search to be within the first few people to apply to some of these.
`software engineer developer "intern" canada after:2025-02-19 -management -marketing -instagram first year`
