WIP - I am turning this into a researched essay

A cursory glance. That's all you need to take before pressing down on the "accept changes" button. On one hand, I'm developing faster than I was before, but on the other hand, I'm not _developing_ at all.

Ok, but surely making things is better than not making things, regardless of the means we take?

Thus begins the slippery slope.

# My Qualms with Cursor and other Agentic Tools

Thesis: Cursor is drugs for coding. When participating in recreational drug use, extreme caution must be taken else you shouldn't use them at all. This caution is in the form of: writing your own tests, planning specifications ahead of time,

1. It's so easy to become dependent on the tool (addiction)

-   One can get away with doing a sloppy job (convenience; sloppy jobs stem from relapse / reliance)
-   Most don't have enough domain knowledge to tell if what's being outputted is correct or not

2. Focuses on outputs rather than methods to get there
3. When you get stuck, you're stuckkk

Let's first discuss my discipline.

I find that I can't stop robbing myself of the journey in pursuit of the destination. I started off by reading Cursor's outputs. But then that turned into only reading every other file. Then skimming. Then auto-accepting and relying on version control to revert back when things break.

Cursor is drugs. It's adderall for coding.

And I will admit that I've tried these drugs. I bought a ton of pills actually (I need to get through 300 premium fast requests in the next 7 days). Ultimately I don't think I have the discipline to not get addicted by them.

With the nights that I've spent outputting code with Cursor, I don't think I planned any of my code whatsoever. Vibe coding without specifications isn't software engineering. You're following where the vibes take you, whether you like it or not.

The second issue, intertwined with the first, is that I don't really know what's going on.

I thought Cursor was liberating, that I didn't need to know the syntax of Go or Rust to make a project. But then when things inevitably break, I am confuddled. With such a convenient easy way out, I return to the Composer tab and prompt once again.

‘programming by coincidence’ [50]: throw enough code at the wall to see what sticks. When it
looks as though the code works, developers move on to the next task.
