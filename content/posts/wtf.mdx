This is a lot to do with mathematical proofs and my struggle with them
Naturally I don't enjoy the process of being stuck
Because, well, I'm stuck
There's no conceivable way to continue the problem I'm just cooked
So I don't spend a lot of time doing proofs
I don't know if the people saying "I love problem solving" relish the feeling of being stuck; maybe it's the payoff from getting over it.

But there's a lot of value to it and I'm recently forcing myself to lock in to them
They teach WTFing
Just like Leetcode

This is the core of problem solving
If you've seen the problem before then you can easily do the steps to fix it
But that's not really problem solving that's just practice
Real problem solving is when it's so cooked

I need to be saying WTF more often
but then the key is CONTINUING
pushing through the WTF until I find WTF this means
