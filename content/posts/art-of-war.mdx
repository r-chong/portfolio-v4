My dad had these comics about different books like "The Art of War", some different zen teachings. They were very good. I forget the author, but that was my first introduction to Sun Tzu's "The Art of War".

Now I've since had the fortune of finding a translated copy in a random value village, and I'm gonna read it. Below is going to be some of the quotes in my interpretations of them with respect to my own experiences which are often circled around tech and startups and business. But also just the underlying idea of competition itself.

I used to get this confused with Tolstoy's War and Peace
