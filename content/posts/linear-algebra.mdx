"If you cannot explain something in simple terms, you don't understand it"

note: everything I'm saying is probably wishy washy and vague so take it with a grain of salt.
This is a WIP that will be complete by the time I finish the course.

intended audience: people in first year who completed high school math just fine, but haven't studied for lin alg yet. perhaps it's the weekend before the midterm

# Linear Algebra

What is Linear Algebra?

-   let's break it down
-   Linear. lines. just lines?
-   we're talking about lines but generalized to all dimensions
-   what are these dimensions? planes, hyperplanes, and vector spaces

-   remember substitution, elimination, where you solved for a variable in high school?
    what if we had 100 variables? we can use linear algebra to solve those.

# early concepts

## vectors

-   it's the meta. represented in a few different ways depending on your industry
-   in physics they're arrows... lines with directions
-   in math they're abstract elements of a vector space (will explain) but also shown as arrows
-   in cs they're an array/list of numbers
    -   at one point I was confused how a lot of LLM work is based on "vectors" as in arrows, like physics, but then I watched the first episode of 3blue1brown's essence of linear algebra

## matrices

-   matrices are a syntax we use to put multiple linear equations together

INSERT IMAGE OF: matrix that is 3 equations, 3 long
we would say we have a matrix of 3 equation in 3 variables

-   we take all the **coefficients** of equation 1 and put them in a little array
-   same for equation 2
-   same for equation 3

what does this look like outside of a matrix?
looks like this
a1x + b1y + c1z + constant
a2x + b2y + c2z + constant
a3x + b3y + c3z + constant

so looking down the columns, you can see that the first column finds us x,
the second column finds us y,
the third column finds us z.

it's at this point you might say, well where's the constant in the matrix? we kinda need that

so the one above is actually called the coefficient matrix, because, it has just the coefficients
they have a different form of the matrix called the augmented matrix which includes the constants and a little line dividing the variables from the constants.

## let's solve the matrix

so we're stumbling onto some natural rules for solving linear equations... we can't get past these

> When solving linear systems, we are trying to isolate each variable. We can't do so if:
> a) the coefficients are more than 1
> b) there are still other variables present

-   it turns out there's a specific state of matrices that we like to go to and it's called REF

### what is REF?

actually, it's a tier-system

(insert image of REF and REF+)

row echelon form

1. Leading entry is 1 and to the right of the ones before it
2. Everything below a leading entry is zero
3. All rows w/ only zeros are at the bottom

I'm gonna explain why we follow each of these rules
and also how it forms a staircase pattern

### what is RREF (REF+)

bonus rule 4) Leading 1 is the only non-zero in the column

### free variables

for free??

### 1) why does the leading entry have to be 1

why can't it be the number 2 or 3

it's hard to isolate stuff when your coefficient is like 2 or something right
and it's even harder when there are multiple versions like

2x + 3y + 5z = 12  
 4y + 6z = 8  
 3z = 9

so you can probably start solving this matrix as it stands
you'd sub z = 3 into the first and second equations
but keep in mind that we have a 2 in front of the x
we're gonna have to remember to "divide" that two out eventually or else we'll have an answer that's double our x value.

so why don't we just "divide" everything by two from the start?
\*the reason I'm writing "divides" in air quotes is because division doesn't always exist in linear algebra; I mean it works in real numbers, but when we turn it into our matrix they don't allow that. so just think about it as multiplying by the inverse (1/2 in this case)

that's why we want all of our coefficients to be one.

### 2) Everything below a leading entry is zero

consider this
x + 2y = 6  
2x + 5y = 11

notice that both equations have an x in it
we don't know what x OR y are equal to

well how do we find them?
let's multiply (x +2y = 6) by 2

do
2x + 5y -(2x + 4y) = 11 - 12
y = -1

nice, x is gone and we found y. now just substitute. I'm not gonna do that but we just solved the system of equations.

now, this is what it looks like in matrix form
we zeroed out x in the second row
that's all that REF is saying we should do here

### 3) All rows w/ only zeros are at the bottom

this just reinforces our staircase pattern
otherwise you might stick a 0 row in the middle somewhere

you may say, what's the harm with mixing the zeros in?
zero rows don't contribute new information (rank, we'll talk about it later) so it's just a convenient habit
