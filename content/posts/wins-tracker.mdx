description: Keeping track of the good moments

I’ve begun to track my daily wins. Anything that makes me feel like I got something done, it goes in. Any sort of accomplishment, or just random things that happened to go well today.

I think this is good for combatting the shit feeling that I feel sometimes at the end of a day when I haven’t completed a major goal I set for that day. It's bad to procrastinate the goals you set out to do; I agree.

However, I do find that my “procrastination” is not scrolling Tiktok or Instagram reels, I end up on LinkedIn and connect with people or apply for jobs. So you could say I’m quite productive at some of these small things.

As I work on wrangling myself into doing the big tasks, I think keeping track of my small wins will keep me sane.
