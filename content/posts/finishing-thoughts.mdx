I have so many random thoughts that I just write into a notepad, save the notepad, and then I never open that notepad again.

I think if I just start sharing them on this blog, I'll actually be forced to finish the thought. I think that's really important because if you finish the thought, the thought goes from an orphaned idea to a part of a collective. If it's posted, then maybe that sparks an idea in someone else or creates a connection.

I'm going to start doing that: take my thoughts, turn them into blog posts (that means I polish them up) and then just push them to this repository which will go on my website.
