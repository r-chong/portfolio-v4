I believe that you can only be described as something if you show up every day consistently. Thus, I'm not a whole lot at all.

Some things that I'm chasing:

-   Being a low level programmer that actually types - no ai vibe coding
-   Someone who goes to the gym regularly
-   Someone who does math regularly
-   Someone who reads books regularly
-   Someone who goes running rugularly
-   Someone who practices storytelling regularly
-   Someone who learns computer networking regularly

...
Let alone

-   Someone who does leetcode
-   Someone working on xr and unity projects
-   Someone learning shaders
