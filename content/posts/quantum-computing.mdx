Quantum computing is definitely one of those fields in its infancy right now.

I predict that it'll become mainstream, whether that's in 20 years or a century from now, who knows. But I do know that when it does become mainstream, the people studying now will see their labours come to fruition and then every CEO guru who's currently riding the AI hype train will change their linkedin bio to be "quantum enthusiast" "quantum evangelist" "majorana major" and start creating Twitter posts about "How you can effectively leverage quantum for your B2B SaaS business."

I won't pretend to know anything about this field. I keep hearing the same explanation that everyone on YouTube likes to give about bits being binary and qubits having superposition, and of course the schroedinger's cat analogy. I don't get how Microsoft was able to create a Quantum chip, because isn't the whole idea of superposition the fact that quantum is unstable and hard to transmit information because it collapses when observed?

I want to look into it more to clear up some of this ignorance.

Topics to explore:

-   Quantum Information Theory?
-   Majorana Chip
