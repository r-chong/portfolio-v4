The backend server went down at my company, Elastic Energy (100% unrelated to me, for real!)

Long story short, I had some time to work on some non-essential things for the business.

Was playing around with svgs and I found this cool website that allows you to create animated svgs based on stroke paths

1. Inkscape the logo into a set of strokes
2. Go to https://svgartista.net/
3. Take svg and modify properties with css
   4. (optional) record gifs using screen recorder

Cool guide from Josh Comeau (goat!) that came out literally a few days after I wrote this note
