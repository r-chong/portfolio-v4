I was thinking about whether or not I should structure my next portfolio website like [Ayush's](https://ayushgarg.ca)

But I don't want to just show my notes. Rather than just publicizing my notes, I'd rather write new posts with the intention to be read.

I really enjoyed taking the time to write an essay in high school and now I'm free to write whatever I'd like.
