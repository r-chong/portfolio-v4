Interesting reddit thread on reading a lot of books at once:

> A great teacher I had in HS actually would have our class reading 6-8 different books at a time in her Literature class. We were expected to finish them all in as many weeks, and often fewer. Many of us struggled with this volume of work and she had us try an approach to achieve this. The method is to take 5-6 different books, and to read them all for 15 minutes each, swapping in order. It accomplishes a few things to improve reading skill and comprehension. First, it forces you to restrict your indulging in material you prefer and allows you manageable ways to finish material you don’t enjoy. Second, it keeps the mind and eyes fresh (hands and arms too), reducing the urge to nap or to stop. I was concerned about losing track of my place in the different materials but this concern dissipated quickly as I did the practice. I was always a straight A student in all my years of education but I swear to God I realized after learning this method that there was so much about reading I didn’t know. I describe that teacher as the one who actually taught me how to be a reader. It was life changing for me. Maybe most of y’all are already galactic brained but for those who aren’t, give it a shot!
