I believe that AI-generated content in terms of blog posts and creative works is a bad idea. If something really means something to you, then you should write it yourself. I do believe that. I've seen on other people's websites, they have a /AI website page where it says "oh, I don't use AI for anything at all in my content," and I want to be like that too. So I pledge that all of my content is going to be written by me.

The best way I've heard someone put it is that, "if someone can't be bothered to make this content, then why should I be bothered to read it?"
However, I'd like to acknowledge something that many of those /AI pages do not. That, as a Gen Z who has found much convenience in ChatGPT (not in my assignments or anything... Policy 71 of course) as a learning tool and as something that I use to write job applications and cover letters, one can easily get used to not writing.

This ease of creating text means that my old writer brain got brain-rotted. It's like muscle shrink. I feel so brain-rotted that sometimes I'm writing some of my blog, and I just want to auto-complete the rest with ChatGPT. It's bad, I know.

As writers, my generation only headed in a worse direction. Gen Z may be the very last people to have to actually write their own essays, as all the gen alphas are going to use ChatGPT starting from a younger age. You could call it poetic, that the act of writing words and letters ends with the generation named after the final letter of the alphabet.

Gen Alpha will have writers for sure, but a large portion of them are never going to write their own content in school, nor out of it. With respect to writers' voice, our humanity is going to be drowned out by a thousand robot screams. See: [the dead internet theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Internet_theory)

There's a dying type of blog where I can't help but open every single article in a new tab because they all pique my interest. My hope is that I can create another one of those blogs.

I'm going to write everything myself. It's hard, but I will, and with that, I will regain my writing voice.
