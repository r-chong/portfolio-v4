There's a dying type of blog where I can't help but open every single article in a new tab because they all pique my interest. I have a hunch that these really original blogs aren't done with the help of AI.

I believe that using AI to write your content is the best way to turn your ideas into the most bland-sounding speech ever. This is completely fine for a lot of things, like if you're writing emails or you're hired as a marketing guru or something.

But for creative works, the best way I've heard someone put it is that, "If someone can't be bothered to make this, then why should I be bothered to read it?" I'd also like to go ahead and acknowledge something that many of those /AI pages do not.

As a Gen Z who has found much convenience in ChatGPT as a learning tool and as something that I use to write job applications and cover letters, I find it difficult to write a piece of (non-academic) text without checking it through GPT for grammar and restructuring.

The best way to put it is that my writing muscle shrunk. Sometimes I'm writing this blog, and I just want to auto-complete the rest with ChatGPT. It's actually bad.

As writers, my generation is only headed in a worse direction. Gen Z may be the very last people to have to actually write their own essays, as all the gen alphas are going to use ChatGPT starting from a younger age. You could call it poetic, that the act of writing words and letters ends with the generation named after the final letter of the alphabet.

Writers won't be extinct with gen alpha, but a large portion of them are never going to write their own content in school, let alone outside of it. Our human writer's voices will be drowned out by a thousand robot screams. See: [the dead internet theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Internet_theory)

I'm going to write everything myself. It's hard, but I will, and with that, I will regain my writing voice.
