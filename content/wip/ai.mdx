I believe that AI-generated content in terms of blog posts and creative works is a bad idea. If something really means something to you, then you should write it yourself. I do believe that. I've seen on other people's websites, they have a /AI website page where it says "oh, I don't use AI for anything at all in my content," and I want to be like that too. So I pledge that all of my content is going to be written by me. As someone else put it, "if someone can't be bothered to make this content, then why should I be bothered to read it?"

But at the same time, I'd like to acknowledge something that many of those /AI pages do not. That, as a Gen Z who has found much convenience int ChatGPT (not in my assignments or anything... Policy 71 of course) but just as a learning tool and as something that I use to write job applications and cover letters. This ease of creating text means that my old writer brain got brain-rotted. It's like muscle shrink. I feel so brain-rotted that sometimes I'm writing some of my blog, and I just want to auto-complete the rest with ChatGPT.

It's bad, I know.

We're only headed in a worse direction. My generation may be the very last people to have to actually write their own essays, as all the gen alphas are going to use ChatGPT starting from a younger age. They are never going to write their own content. In terms of writers' voice, our humanity is going to be drowned out by a thousand robot screams. See: the dead internet theory

That's my /AI page. I'm going to write everything myself. It's admittedly hard, but I will, and with that, I will regain my writing voice.
