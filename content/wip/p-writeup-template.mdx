## What I Learned From Building Lexplora

Looking back, creating Lexplora taught me a few things.

1. **Respond to peoples' cool projects!** When Bashir first shared his original idea in a mutual discord server we were in, I responded, which led to him inviting me to the project.

2. **It's neat to have friends in other states**. I'm really happy I met these two, and I feel that we made a real connection despite never meeting in person and barely ever doing video calls.
3. **Small Steps Add Up.** Whether it’s building an app or learning a new skill, consistency truly is key. This was my first time using the Next.js framework, so I was mostly relying on my React skills and doing frontend until I got up to speed.

4. **Going Tiktok Viral is Easier Said Than Done**. Marketing theoretically isn't that hard, but I truly realized how much of its own grind it is when I took on the challenge of posting across our social media platforms.

I'll always remember this summer-long whirlwind of creativity, collaboration, and late-night breakthroughs—and the result is an app I’m proud of to this date.
