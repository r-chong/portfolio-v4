I had a conversation with my friend's brother the other days
Basically "lock in lil bro" though not in his words
Companies like Apple care, you don't want to filter yourself out

On the other hand I want to build cool things
While you can do both, I'm still trying to get better at time management and neglecting school a LITTLE is a shortcut to building things I like

I think it's nuanced

I can't Not-give-a-fuck
I need to care enough about my grades to streamline the process of WTF'ing
And learning about how I work best, how I get into flow state
And being able to work around classes that seem like useless chores (i.e., BBA)
As I'm never going to find a job where I love 100% of every single participating

I also can't want grades so badly that I'll kill myself if I don't get them

I'm not doing a great job academically
Still working on it
But this is one of the reasons why I 99% would not drop out
