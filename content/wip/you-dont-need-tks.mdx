Just wanted to do a quick little dictation for my blog because I was thinking about TKS and SHAD and everything like that.

Because I was looking at Nosher's message to me asking do I know Victoria from Socratica, and I said we went to the same summer camp years ago. For some reason I just wanted to think about how might he interpret that response? Maybe he thinks we went to SHAD or we went to TKS together, but I actually hate those. Why you shouldn't need to pay money to network, but at the same time I do believe you should pay to invest in yourself. That's not the way to invest in yourself, there really is no contradiction here. These places can't buy by exploiting parents who want to get their kid ahead and they just add a price tag to that. But the thing is, yes you meet people, you can still meet those people in university. And you might argue, why is this in university? I think there is a nuance to it. University, I'm still working on a nuance. I do think university is much better. A) it's similar costs, so you might as well save it. But does that tell us anything? That's an argument that you can surbottle as well. I'm still working on the exact arguments, but I don't think TKS is all these other things I'm working on. The end of the day they're just compromise. This is your business, you are the product or you are your customer, the product is a practice but that doesn't always come at all. Just get correct by yourself, then come to university and meet people. I guarantee you, if you don't have any value to add, don't join TKS. If you don't have any value to add, they'll be like one of the minions at TKS because they just give those top ones that send everything in these other modules and something. Don't do that. This also kind of expands into how do you network as a high school student? All it takes is honestly go to events, find a group or more events with them, and then like if there are repeats, honestly hackathon, if there's a yawn party that's supposed to be a crypto thing, you just need to be in centric and do your job. Hopefully your parents are kind of on board with you, but even if you have no marriage after high school, just trust university they'll come.
