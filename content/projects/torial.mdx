Ever stared at your dense textbook and had a specific question with JUST the answer and no explanation? Wish you could watch math and science concepts unfold in motion?

You're not alone, and that's exactly why my friend Arsh and I built **Torial**.

Torial is a text-to-Manim video API that brings your course material to life through stunning mathematical animations.

## The Problem We Solved

Traditional learning materials often fall short when it comes to visualizing complex concepts. Static textbooks and slides can make it difficult to grasp dynamic mathematical relationships and scientific processes. We wanted to bridge that gap by making visual learning accessible to everyone.

We've seen a number of attempted solutions from other EdTech companies, however they seem to fall short; the layout sometimes overflows, or the voiceover isn't in sync.

## What Torial Does

Torial transforms any mathematical or scientific concept into an animated video in under 30 seconds while ensuring high quality outputs.

## Technical Implementation

Trytorial leverages the power of **Manim** (Mathematical Animation Engine) - the same library used by 3Blue1Brown for their famous mathematical visualizations. Our system:

-   **Text Processing**: Takes natural language descriptions of mathematical concepts
-   **Code Generation**: Converts text into Manim Python code using AI
-   **Video Rendering**: Executes the code to generate smooth, professional animations
-   **Delivery**: Serves the final video in web-optimized format

## Evolution to B2B

While Torial started as a consumer-focused tool for students, we've since recognized the massive potential in the B2B education space. Educational institutions, content creators, and ed-tech companies need high-quality mathematical visualizations at scale.

This pivot reflects our learning about product-market fit and the sustainability of our vision in the broader education technology landscape.

## What I Learned

Building Trytorial taught me several valuable lessons:

1. **Resource Management**: Running a free service with our own funding made us hyper-aware of cost optimization and usage patterns.

2. **User Experience**: The constraint of "no signup required" forced us to create an incredibly streamlined user experience.

3. **Technical Challenges**: Integrating AI text processing with mathematical rendering presented unique challenges in accuracy and performance.

4. **Market Validation**: Sometimes the most obvious use case isn't the most sustainable one - B2B often provides better unit economics than consumer products.
