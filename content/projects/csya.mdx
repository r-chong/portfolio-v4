### CSYA

I first stumbled upon the Computer Science Youth of America (CSYA) during one of their online hackathons, [CSYAHacks](https://csyahacks.devpost.com/). I signed up, because I'm a Canadian who signs up for a lot of American things.

After participating in CSYAHacks, I was inspired by the organization’s mission and decided to contribute my skills. I joined as a web developer, eager to help CSYA’s vision come to life.

Initially, the website was built on Wix, a beginner-friendly platform but one that lacked flexibility and performance for a global nonprofit.

That’s where my journey began: transitioning CSYA’s site to a modern framework, Next.js. This wasn’t just a technical upgrade; it was about making the platform faster and more accessible to over 950 students from 15+ countries.

Countries like Bangladesh, Indonesia, Egypt, and Tanzania were just a few on that list—places where reliable internet isn’t always a given. By improving page load times by 30%, we made it easier for students with limited bandwidth to access our resources.

### Lessons Learned and the Road Ahead

Looking back, my journey with CSYA has taught me that encouragement is as important as education. Resources alone aren’t enough if students feel isolated or unsure about their potential.

Organizations like CSYA help bridge that gap by providing a network of support and inspiration.

I spent a year at CSYA, and the impact we’ve had is clear. With a structure that ensures leadership continuity and a mission that resonates globally, CSYA is set to inspire and empower students for years to come.

I’m proud to have been part of this journey and to have played a small role in helping others discover their passion for computer science.
