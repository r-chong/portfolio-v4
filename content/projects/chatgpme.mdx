goal: show the person reading this that I'm technical

This is definitely my most playful project. My team and I were wanting to make a cool project at Hack the North 2024, but we didn't want it to just be another cliche, unoriginal GPT wrapper. But one way to convert stale ideas into fresh ones is to be self-aware. What if we made a game where **you** are the GPT Wrapper?

### Inspired by games like Overcooked...

ChatGPMe challenges you to write responses to prompts while sounding like an LLM. Each round brings a series of questions ranging from requests for life advice, to calls for emotional support. Did I mention that we're grading how much you sound like an AI?
