The COVID-19 pandemic drastically reduced in-person interactions. Many struggle with conveying confidence and engagement during networking opportunities like coffee chats.

**[Coffee Coach](https://devpost.com/software/coffee-coach)** helps users hone their non-verbal communication skills\*\* by analyzing facial expressions in real time and providing feedback to ensure a confident and engaging presence during conversations.

### **How It Works**

-   **Pre-Chat Preparation**

    -   Users input meeting details (who they’re meeting, duration, etc.).
    -   AI chatbot (GPT-3.5 API) generates a structured conversation plan with suggested topics.
    -   Provides sample questions to guide the discussion.

-   **Real-Time Sentiment & Expression Analysis**
    -   Uses MediaPipe Face Detection & Face API to track facial expressions.
    -   Performs sentiment analysis to detect mood changes (e.g., disengaged, irritated, neutral).
    -   Sends real-time feedback prompts to encourage a more engaging presence.

### **Tech Stack & Implementation**

-   **Frontend:** React, JavaScript
-   **Authentication:** Auth0
-   **Computer Vision:**
    -   **MediaPipe** for face tracking & expression detection
    -   **Face API** for real-time sentiment analysis
-   **AI & NLP:**
    -   **GPT-4 API** to generate structured prompts and conversation plans
    -   **Sentiment Analysis** to evaluate user engagement
-   **Cloud Services:**
    -   We initially planned to use **Microsoft Azure Content Moderation & Speech-to-Text APIs**, but we were high schoolers with no credit card.

### **Challenges & Key Takeaways**

At times, we doubted the feasibility of our project. This was our second pivot and had the potential to be our third. Each of real-time sentiment analysis, AI-driven prompts, and computer vision—each component brought its own complexities. But through team collaboration, persistence, and ultimately sticking with our idea, we pushed through obstacles.

This was my first experience working with computer vision libraries. I was also new to the OpenAI API, and so implementing a functional AI-driven feedback system took a bit of time.

Ultimately Coffee Coach is just the beginning. We're excited to keep improving it and helping students refine their communication skills to succeed in coffee chats!
