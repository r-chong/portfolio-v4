## The Problem with Closed Educational Platforms

I think there's definitely an issue with proprietary educational platforms. They can disappear, change pricing, or simply ignore their users.
If you're providing the content, you shouldn't have to pay to see it in other forms...

There's so many open source learning materials (opencourseware) available, the only value-added these EdTech platforms provide is the AI features, which is trivial since they're mostly API wrappers.

## The plan

Build a web application that creates a personalized learning experience through:

-   **Curriculum-specific data** by embedding your exact study material
-   **Interactive flashcards** based on your study material
-   **Infinite mock exams** based on your study material
-   **Summaries and explanations** again, based on your study material

Everything comes down to the embeddings part which I already have done.

## Technical Vision

The core technical challenge I'm tackling is implementing a CDN that integrates seamlessly with vector databases. This architecture will enable lightning-fast AI features while keeping the entire system scalable and cost-effective.

The vector integration is almost solid right now, but I've temporarily paused development as I started work & also Torial

Current Status: Work in Progress

### What's Next

-   Building out the question generation pipeline
-   Creating an intuitive study dashboard
-   Open sourcing the entire codebase

Dojang isn't just about studying. It's about building educational tools that belong to the community, not to corporations.
