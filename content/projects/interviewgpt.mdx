This is **InterviewGPT**, automated Leetcode interviews right in the CLI.
It’s built to make coding interviews simple, effective, and recruiter-friendly.

I was challenged to make this project by Akshat Prakash. Challenge accepted.

### Features

There are two main question types: **code-based** and **concept questions**.
But it doesn’t stop there. InterviewGPT asks follow-up questions and gets you to explain your answers when needed.

The CLI gives helpful prompts like:

-   "Please enter a valid file path"
-   "You can type in the chat for this question"

Other key features:

-   **AI interviewer**: Asks one question at a time, follows up to ensure full comprehension, and stays structured throughout the interview.
-   **Transcript recording**: Keeps a full log of your answers and your code so recruiters can see how you think and solve problems.
-   **Variable interview length**: Typically ~45 minutes, but adjusts depending on the flow.
-   Built using GPT-3.5 (but will upgrade to better APIs soon!).

### Backend

The backend is where the magic happens.

Firestore handles security, validating keys so only registered candidates can access the platform.  
It can also generate new keys and link them to candidate emails for tracking.

After the interview, results are emailed in a MIM-formatted summary.
This makes it super easy for recruiters to read:

-   A summarized transcript (thanks to LangChain).
-   Scores, stats, and a verdict on the candidate.

I even added timestamps to track how long candidates spend on each question.  
This helps flag anything suspicious, like answers that are too fast.
